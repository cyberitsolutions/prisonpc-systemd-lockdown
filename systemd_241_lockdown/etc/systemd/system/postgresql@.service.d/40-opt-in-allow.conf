# If database and app are on the SAME HOST, you can connect them via
# unix sockets (the default behaviour), and leave networking blocked.
# See listen_address='' in postgresql.conf.
#
# However I am allowing networking by default because
#
#   * Autovacuum MUST have UDP (for the stats collector);
#   * The default config listens to localhost:postgresql; &
#   * Large deployments ALWAYS have separate hosts.
#
# CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE remains blocked, because
# the default port (5432) is a high port.
