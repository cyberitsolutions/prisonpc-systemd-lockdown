# See 30-allow-mail-postfix-via-msmtp.conf for details.

# Short version:
# postdrop needs either sgid postdrop (NoNewPrivileges=no), or CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE.
# This drop-in does the former, by allowing CAP_SYS_ADMIN.
# Other lockdown (e.g. SystemCallFilter=) doesn't force
# NoNewPrivileges=yes when we run as root with CAP_SYS_ADMIN.

[Service]
# This has to run as root (to get CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE), and
User=
# This has to be able to resolve the postdrop group (FIXME: I think?)

# "main.cf sanity check" prints a harmless warning.
