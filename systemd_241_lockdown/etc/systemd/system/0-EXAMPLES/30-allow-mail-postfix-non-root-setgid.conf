# Short version:
# postdrop needs either sgid postdrop (NoNewPrivileges=no), or CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE.
# This does the former with *NOT* running as root (e.g. mariadb.service), by
# removing all the lockdown that forces NoNewPrivileges=yes.
# WARNING: because that's so unpleasant, this drop-in is NOT TESTED!

[Service]
# This has to be able to resolve the postdrop group (FIXME: I think?)
PrivateUsers=no


# Any of these would force NoNewPrivileges=yes.
# FIXME: how to remove restrictions of SystemCallFilter= and
#        CapabilityBoundingSet= set by an earlier dropin?
