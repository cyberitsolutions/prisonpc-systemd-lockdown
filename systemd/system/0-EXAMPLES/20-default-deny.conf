# In Debian 10 Buster, systemd 241 provides "systemd-analyze security".
# This tells you all the things you can do to constrain a service unit.
#
# USAGE:
#   1. systemctl edit frobozz.service
#   2. paste in this file, edit ALLOW rules, save, quit
#   3. systemctl restart frobozz || systemctl status frobozz
#   4. if it failed, go to 1
#
# The idea of this file is a combination of "default-deny" and
# "defence-in-depth" doctrines.  If something should NEVER HAPPEN,
# then it doesn't hurt to encoding that in the daemon *and* in
# systemd, *and* in AppArmor/SELinux!  That way, if one layer screws
# up, it will still be blocked.
#
# FOR EXAMPLE, dovecot.service should never need to modprobe netconsole.ko;
# if it tries that, something is DEEPLY wrong, and it can be blocked.
#
#
# While *I* think systemd lockdown should be "opt out", systemd only provides an "opt in" mechanism.
# That means every time systemd adds a new security feature, overworked daemon maintainers need to know about it and try turning it on.
# Otherwise, it does nothing.
#
# As a sysadmin, adding in opt-ins by hand gets a bit repetetive.
# The purpose of THIS FILE is to provide a reference to simplify that process.
# There are two parts:
#
#   1. DEFAULT DENY   (this is the same for all units)
#   2. ALLOW          (this is unit-specific and includes a rationale)
#
# Note that if a unit says Foo=bar Foo=baz, they (usually) "add together".
# To "zero out" a rule, you instead need Foo=bar Foo= Foo=baz, to get ONLY baz.
#
# WARNING: "systemd-analyze security" DOES NOT list ALL .service units.
# e.g. it lists rsync.service even if you have no /etc/rsyncd.conf.
# e.g. it omits logrotate.service even though a timer runs it.
#
# WARNING: DO NOT try to lock down getty or ssh.  Even though
# pam_systemd.so + logind cause the user session to be reparented into
# its own slice, grawity on #systemd says that lockdown of getty/ssh
# WILL still affect the user session.
#
# WARNING: be extra careful of anything with DefaultDependencies=no.
# These are usually early boot units, and
# some things like PrivateUsers= seem to Just Not Work for them?

# systemd-analyze security doesn't mention this, but it's relevant!

#ReadWritePaths=
#ReadWritePaths=/var/lib/frobozz

# When a daemon wants to make /run/frobozz.pid,

# It is tighter to RuntimeDirectory=frobozz and tell the daemon to use
# /run/frobozz/frobozz.pid.

# systemd-analyze security does not consider service denial attacks.  We do!
# Some need tuning for the host's hardware/load/role.
# Therefore I am leaving them as "opt in" for now.
# These three are equivalent to "nice ionice -c3 chrt --idle 0".
# It puts it at the back of the queue when it comes to resource allocation.
# These are appropriate for "cron job" type processes, but NOT daemons.
#Nice=10
#CPUSchedulingPolicy=batch
#IOSchedulingClass=idle
# This says it can use up to one CPU core's worth of time.
# It's appropriate for things SHOULD be single threaded.
# It's not appropriate for things like pigz or xz -T0.
# This is likely to be a hardware-specific choice.
#CPUQuota=100%
# This mitigates forkbombs.
# Even something like apache can probably set a high mark here.
#TasksMax=16
# SHORT VERSION: use MemoryHigh= (instead of nocache) for jobs like updatedb.
# LONG VERSION follows.
# RAM is faster than HDD, so Linux uses idle RAM as an HDD cache, the "page cache".
# When apps need more RAM, part of the page cache must be thrown away.
# The "page replacement algorithm" decides which page is least useful.
# As at 2019, the default PRA ("LRU") is old and stupid.
# https://linux-mm.org/PageReplacementDesign
# As at 2019, an alternative is not ready.
# https://linux-mm.org/AdvancedPageReplacement
#
# In the meantime, a workload that reads a lot of disk blocks ONCE
# will trick the LRU into flushing the page cache, ruining read I/O for other processes.
# Examples include: updatedb, du, find.
#
# When your unit acts like one of these, you can wrap it in nocache,
# which uses LD_PRELOAD to add FADV_DONTNEED to most disk I/O.
# https://github.com/Feh/nocache
#
# A more robust alternative is to set MemoryHigh= to more than the
# process needs, but much less than the amount of RAM you have.
# Because MemoryHigh= count includes page cache,
# it should prevent the unit from flushing the WHOLE page cache.
# https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cgroup-v2.txt
# It is hard to know in advance what a good number for this should be.
# This is likely to be a unit-specific choice.
# Some units will scale with load, e.g. dovecot, postfix, apache.
# Some units won't scale with load, e.g. man-db.
#MemoryHigh=128M
