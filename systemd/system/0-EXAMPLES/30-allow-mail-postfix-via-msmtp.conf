# This is a good choice is your unit DOESN'T run as root.
# This is a good choice is your unit needs root and internet access anyway.

# PROBLEM:
#
#   1. daemon calls /usr/sbin/sendmail to send an email
#      (possibly via /usr/bin/mail wrapper).
#
#   2. /usr/sbin/sendmail is provided by postfix, your MTA.
#      That in turn calls postdrop to write to /var/spool/postfix/maildrop.
#
#      This works for unprivileged users because postdrop is sgid postdrop.
#      This works for privileged users (i.e. root) via CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE.
#
#   3. When NoNewPrivileges=yes, setgid WILL NOT WORK, so postdrop fails.
#
#      Worse, ANY OF THE FOLLOWING will set NoNewPrivileges=yes,
#      EVEN WHEN YOU SET NoNewPrivileges=no, and
#      EVEN THOUGH systemd-analyze AND systemctl show CLAIM NoNewPrivileges=no.
#
#          SystemCallFilter=
#          SystemCallArchitectures=
#          RestrictAddressFamilies=
#          RestrictNamespaces=

#          ProtectKernelTunables=
#          ProtectKernelModules=
#          MemoryDenyWriteExecute=
#          RestrictRealtime=
#          LockPersonality=
#
#      Having to disable all of these just to fix /usr/sbin/sendmail is *REALLY* annoying.
#
# PROPOSED WORKAROUND:
#
#   a. Tell postfix to trust (allow relay from) localhost.
#      This is the default behaviour anyway.
#
#   b. Install msmtp (but not msmtp-mta), and create a
#      /etc/msmtprc.systemd-NoNewPrivileges like this:
#
#        account default
#          host localhost
#          syslog LOG_MAIL
#          auto_from on
#
#      NB: we use a special file here so that 1. it won't affect
#      "normal" msmtp callers; and 2. systemd will abort with an
#      obvious error if the custom msmtprc doesn't exist.
#
#      NOTE: the "obvious error" is NOT OBVIOUS until v243:
#      https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/7cc5ef5
#
#   c. Instead of allowing all of these:
#
#          NoNewPrivileges=no
#
#          # SystemCallFilter= &c will leave NoNewPrivileges=no alone, but *ONLY IF*
#          # we're running as root (User=) and retain CAP_SYS_ADMIN.
#          User=
#          CapabilityBoundingSet=CAP_SYS_ADMIN

#          RestrictAddressFamilies=AF_INET AF_INET6
#
#      We merely need to allow network access to localhost.
